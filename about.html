            rel="bookmark">Instascan – Hardware-less, Mobile Based Biometric Solution</a></h2>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-4" src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Paysys Labs, a payments and digital financial solutions company provides reliable and secure technology
          platforms that enable banks, telcos and businesses to offer their customers a vast array of payment types,
          across multiple channels, anywhere at any time.</p>
        <p>Keeping in view the modern requirements of bio-metric verification for customer validation, Paysys aimed to
          provide a hardware-less mobile based fingerprint bio-metric scanning application-Instascan. The biometric
          data is extracted from a picture of a finger, taken from a smartphone camera, without requiring any
          additional hardware. The image is then processed in Paysys servers where the designated algorithms extract
          the biometric data from the picture which is then forwarded to the client for NADRA verification.
          Customers of all industry verticals can be biometrically verified anywhere and at any time, without
          organizations incurring additional hardware costs. Be it verification required for opening bank accounts,
          mobile wallets or providing proof-of-life for pension disbursement or at time of delivery of goods etc.
          Instascan covers all use cases.
        </p>
        <p>

          With mobile penetration as high as 79% in Pakistan, 26% of which are smartphone owners, service providers can
          onboard more customers instantly without having to bear expensive costs of physical equipment, especially in
          remote areas. This would also allow the users to reach and target a wider range of audience, digitally, all
          over the country. Unlike the more common hardware solutions, this solution is entirely software-based, which
          gives financial service providers the ability to deploy it faster as compared to those that are
          hardware-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another highlight of Instascan is its instant enrollment for customers. Since the solution is not a
          standalone application, it can be integrated by any financial service provider through open APIs. That means,
          banks can facilitate account opening through their mobile banking application. At the back-end, the solution
          can easily be integrated with any existing core banking system. Since all information would be taken from
          customers digitally and authenticated instantly via NADRA, our solution can provide the required data
          electronically to the bank. Similarly, the solution can also be used for other use cases as well, where a
          user wants to subscribe an insurance plan remotely, from anywhere in the country at their own convenience.
          The solution can be integrated with the insurance company’s existing mobile solution and relevant data can be
          forwarded securely.
        </p>
        <h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default">Existing Clients</h2>
        <p>JS bank was the first bank in Pakistan to integrate Instascan, providing convenient ways to their customers
          to authenticate themselves and avail banking services instantly. The solution is not only catering
          approximately 1000 verification requests per day but is also used for “Over the Counter” transactions meeting
          the regulatory requirements of biometric verification. Currently, the solution is also being deployed at IGI
          Insurance Limited. The solution will enable IGI insurance to seamlessly incorporate biometric authentication
          through open APIs, without incurring costs of a purpose-built hardware and concerning themselves with factor
          redesigns.</p>
        <h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default">The Future</h2>
        <p>
          In the times of increasing branchless operations and digitizing of the financial services, Instascan is a
          feasible alternative to conventional biometric verification procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karim Jindani, Chief Executive Officer of Paysys Labs commented:
          <strong>” It is still early days for Instascan with a lot of market potential. We strongly believe that
            secure
            &amp; friction-less identity verification is one of the major challenge in digital financial services space
            in Pakistan today. Instascan, will provide banks, telcos, courier service providers a seamless and purely
            digital process that can be used to authenticate and verify potential customers anywhere and at any-time.”</strong></p>
